## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week. Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(week_day = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(vegetable, week_day) %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(daily_wt_lbs = sum(wt_lbs)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = vegetable,
              names_from = week_day,
              values_from = daily_wt_lbs,
              values_fill = 0)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the `plot` variable from the `plant_date_loc` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_summary <- garden_harvest %>%
  group_by(vegetable, variety, date) %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(daily_wt_lbs = sum(wt_lbs))
  
  garden_summary %>%
  left_join(plant_date_loc,
            by = c("vegetable", "variety"))
```
As shown above, there is a replication of certain vegetables and varieties. For example, in row 17 and 18, the beans(Bush Bush Slender variety) harvested on 2020-07-06 are reported as harvested in both plot M and D. However, in reality these vegetables and variaties have not been harvest twice. When Lisa collected her data, she didn't report the plot where she harvest from. Therefore, there is a replication of certain vegetables and varieties reported while that isn't accurate. This could be fixed if Lisa would report the plot in which each vegetable and variety is harvested. 

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `supply_cost` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.
  
   We would first need to add a variable to the dataset `garden_harvest` that prices the seed mix that is used, we could name this variable: `variety_price`. After creating the variable, we can use a left join by vegetable and select only the price of that vegetable and multiply that by the vegetable's weight in pounds. Next, we could left join `garden_harvest` and `supply_costs` by variety. Finally, we could create a variable called money_saved which would subtract the price of the seed from the `price_with_tax` variable.

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable %in% c("tomatoes")) %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(variety))) +
    geom_bar() +
      labs(title = "Tomatoe Variety",
              x = "Count",
              y = "Variety") 
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety_lower = str_to_lower(variety)) %>%
  mutate(variety_length = str_length(variety)) %>%
  mutate(variety2 = fct_infreq(variety)) %>%
  distinct(vegetable, variety, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(vegetable, variety_length) 
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(has_r = str_detect(variety, "er | ar")) %>%
  distinct(variety, has_r = TRUE)
```

## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}
</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Event Versus Date",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Density")
```
  In the density plot above, we observe that the bikes are rented more often during October and November than in December and January. This can be explained by the transition from spring weather into winter weather. 

  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Event Versus Time of Day",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Density")
```
   In the density plot above, we observe the time of the day that bikes are rented out. As shown, bikes are rented out more often during two specific time periods of the day: early morning between 7am and 8am and in the afternoon between 5pm and 6pm. This can be explained by the fact that people use bikes during this time period to go to work in the morning and to go home in the afternoon. It's the typical rush hour for public transportation.
   
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = days_of_week)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Event Versus Day of the Week",
       x = "Count",
       y = "Day of the Week")
```
  As shown in the bar graph above, bikes are rented out more during the weekdays than during the weekends. This could be explained by the fact that individuals rent these bikes to go from point A to point B during the workweek and therefore don't use a bike on the weekends.
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(~days_of_week) +
    labs(title = "Event Versus Time and Day of the Week",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Density")
```
  There is a clear pattern during the weekdays as well as during the weekends. During the weekdays, there are peaks in the bike rentals during the early morning period before work regular work hours start and in the afternoon after regular work hours have ended. Furthermore, both Saturday and Sunday have extremely similar patterns as most people use these bikes during the day (peak at 3pm) instead of during the early morning and late afternoon. 
  
The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. Repeat the graphic from Exercise \@ref(exr:exr-temp) (d) with the following changes:

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=client), color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(~days_of_week) +
    labs(title = "Event Versus Time and Day of the Week",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Density")
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=client), color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density(position = position_stack()) +
    facet_wrap(~days_of_week) +
    labs(title = "Event Versus Time and Day of the Week",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Density")
```
  
  13. Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(days_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=client), color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density(position = position_stack()) +
    facet_wrap(~weekend) +
    labs(title = "Different Client Usage",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Density")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(days_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=days_of_week), color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density(position = position_stack()) +
    facet_wrap(~client) +
    labs(title = "Different Client Usage",
       x = "Time of The Day",
       y = "Density")
```
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Stations %>%
  left_join(Trips,
  by = c("name" = "sstation")) %>%
    group_by(name) %>% 
    mutate(total_departures = n()) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, color = total_departures)) +
      geom_jitter() +
        labs(title = "Total Departures from Each Rental Location", 
        x = "Longtitude", 
        y ="Latitude")
```
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Stations %>%
  left_join(Trips,
  by = c("name" = "sstation")) %>%
    group_by(client) %>% 
    mutate(percent_casual= mean(client == "Casual")) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, color = percent_casual)) +
      geom_jitter() +
        labs(title = "Total Departures from Each Rental Location", 
        x = "Longtitude", 
        y ="Latitute")
```
  
### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
Top_Trips <- Trips %>%
  mutate(trip_date = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  group_by(sstation, trip_date) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(10)
  Top_Trips
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Top_Trips %>%
  left_join(Trips, by = "sstation")
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.
  
```{r}
Top_Trips %>%
  left_join(Trips, by = "sstation") %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(day_of_week, client) 
```

## GitHub link

  20. Below, provide a link to your GitHub page with this set of Weekly Exercises. Specifically, if the name of the file is 03_exercises.Rmd, provide a link to the 03_exercises.md file, which is the one that will be most readable on GitHub.

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
  

**DID YOU REMEMBER TO UNCOMMENT THE OPTIONS AT THE TOP?**
